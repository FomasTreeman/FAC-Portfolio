## Deployment

Rent Shied is deployed on \`Vercel\`. The Main branch is continuously deployed and can be visited on [this link](https://rent-shield.vercel.app/).

All Pull Requests must meet the following requirements before being merged into the main branch:

- Two collaborating developers have reviewed and approved the request
- The full test suite has been run and passed (this is done automatically when committing any code)
- The pull request includes running and passing tests for any new functionalities in the code (every developer is responsible for testing their code)

## Planning

Development of Rent Shield is tracked using github projects. [This project board](https://github.com/orgs/fac27/projects/36/views/) is updated regularly and informs the roadmap for new features and code base improvements.

We kept to our sprint planning relatively tight and kept to our user stories.
In summary:
We Over estimated complexity by _13.79%_ and under estimated time by _11.33%_ with a total of 29 points worth of tickets.

### MVP

The development of Rent Shield is currently in early stages and is guided towards fulfilling the following user stories:

        name: 'a-maze',
        url: 'https://main--enchanting-churros-a4027f.netlify.app/', md: `# a-maze

-   a game where the user has to navigate through a maze to get to the next level
-   the user has to input their name & sprite
-   the game has a count down
-   the user must figure out how to navigate on the keyboard without using arrows
-   the users name, sprite, current score, best score is recorded in local storage (maybe the date as well?)

## MVP

we need:

-   login page with input for name & sprite (emoji)
-   emoji package?
-   aesthetics - retro gaming console on old computer
-   name, emoji & best score on header, counter & current score on footer
-   check if anything is in local storage first to decide whether to render login page or mazepage

As a user I want to be able to create a username and emoji so that I can differentiate myself from others
As a user I want to be able to come back and continue where I left off
As a user I want to feel like I'm back in the 80s and I want to feel like i'm not on a website but playing a game
As a user I want to be able to play the game and get feedback if I can move in a certain direction (ie. if I walk into a wall I can't go through it and get feedback that it's the wrong way)

## stretch

-   heart emoji for life
-   sliding door timeout - to block the user
-   setTimeout for current score

As a user I want obstacles with every level
As a user I want a way to get rewarded for passing multiple levels
As an advane vm user, I want a way to find the cheat sheet

## SETUP 

1. clone this repo
2. \`\`\`npm install\`\`\`
3. \`\`\`npm run dev\`\`\`
4. PLAY IT, HAVE FUN!`

        name: 'mood-map', url: 'https://mood-map.vercel.app/', md: `# Mood-Map

This project was the in-house project for FAC27.
Mood Map is an app that allows you to visually record your moods or mediations so that you have something to look back on weekly, monthly, and annually.

Please note:

- deployed login is currently not working but can run locally - please see below for instructions
- Adding a mood will add it to the database but currently there is no user feedback that you've recorded a mood
- we do not have a lot of user feedback for loading and error handling
- if you sign up with an email, you must confirm your email address to login

#### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to create a user account and have the app store my credentials so that I can access the app securely
2. As a user, I want to be able to log my mood for the day in 3 taps/clicks or fewer
3. As a user, I want to be able to view my moods summarised in an easy to understand grid colour map

### Instillation

Zaroff's is a retailer of private islands. The homepage shows you a listing of all our exclusive properties, which you can filter by region or - for those of humble finances - by price limit.

You can visit the page of each individual island to find out more about your future property. Once you have made your choice, add your desired islands to the basket and we will charge your AmEx (tax evasion will be respected).

## Testing

Our page has an end to end testing created and run in Cypress.

You can run our page's tests in the terminal.

Make sure the development server is running:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Open a new terminal and run:

\`\`\`bash
npm run test
\`\`\`

Alternatively, you can run the tests in the Cypress app:

Open Cypress application:

\`\`\`
npx cypress open
\`\`\`

Select E2E Testing in the application

Select Chrome as your browser

This website allows you to enter a name and a message for other to read. Although you enter a name, the name will remain anonymous to other users - to replicate the experience of a confessional booth.

Our first project as part of FAC's full time program was to create a microblogging side Our goal was to allow users to submit their own posts and view all the posts submitted by others.

**Roles**

Zack - Facilitator

Tom - UX

Mark - DevOps

Cameo - Testing

User Stories:

    As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them
    As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted
    As an impulsive person, I want to: delete my posts so no one can see them anymore

## Installation

You can either access this site by going to: https://fess-booth-3.fly.dev/

Or after you clone the repo you can:

\`\`\` terminal 
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## Testing
We create 2 tests:

1. test the sanization of the messages posted
2. test the validation of the entering the name and the message

to run the tests enter the following in the terminal:

\`\`\`terminal 
node--test
\`\`\`

both tests should pass successfully 

#### Things that work
- Everything ofc :) Execept we dont like the form drop down floating on the right of the screen
    - having two branches(development to push to & final review and main to deploy)

#### Things that don't work
    - Persistent posts / data across server restarts. (hack to avoid DB could include a git add data; git commit and a git push so we store the data on the repo ready) (maybe:/ )
        - Git did not work well
